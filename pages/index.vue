                    An interest in technology led me to User Experience Design. After starting in and creating
                    the role of Accessibility Specialist at BYU Continuing Education, I realized the power of
                    great design and its impact on our lives. This realization perfectly reflects my lifelong
                    interest in excellent products and the design elements that set them apart from their
                    competition. Soon afterward, I switched my major from Computer Engineering to Information
                    Technology with a personal emphasis on Human-Computer Interactions. This change has allowed
                    me to continue developing a skill set I'd already built and use that skill set to ensure the
                    success of each of the projects I've worked on.
